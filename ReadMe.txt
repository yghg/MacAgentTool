This graphical tool allows you to perform the following actions from macOS:

- Install the Automate Mac Agent
- Get the agent status
- Restart the agent
- Uninstall the agent

Usage is as follows: sudo python ./mac_agent_tool_0_1.py

Future releases will aim to deploy as a macOS application that can run without invoking Python from the command line.
